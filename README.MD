#Explain OOP principles using Javascript    

*__Encapsulation:__ The practice of keeping objects in a private state inside a class. 
This prevents other objects from having direct access.
 Instead, these other objects can only call on public functions or "methods". 

*__Abstraction:__ A natural extension of encapsulation. 
A practice of only exposing a high level mechanism for using an object. 
This means hiding any operations or implementation details that are not relevant to other objects.

*__Inheritance:__   

*__Polymorphism:__ 

*__Single Responsibiliy Principle:__ 

*__Open-Closed Principle:__ 

*__Liskov Substitution:__ 

*__Interface Segregation Principle:__ 

*__Dependency Inversion Principle:__
